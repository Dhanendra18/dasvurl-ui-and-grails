				<h2>Advantages Of Studying In Singapore</h2>

				<p class="fontSize16" >The multicultural and welcoming atmosphere in French Universities attracts students across the globe. Most of the courses are taught in English and students also get an opportunity to learn the French language. The higher rate of success of application, visa and permit for two years post study work visa motivates students to identify courses of their choice. Among other advantages that international students enjoy are the internship opportunities and the possibility to work part time.</p>
				<p class="fontSize16" >The government is defined by the constitution as the Queen acting on the advice of her privy council. However, the Privy Council—consisting mostly of former members of parliament, chief justices of the supreme court, and other elder statesmen—rarely meets in full. As the stipulations of responsible government require that those who directly advise the monarch and governor general on how to exercise the Royal Prerogative be accountable to the elected House of Commons, the day-to- day operation of government is guided only by a sub-group of the Privy Council made up of individuals who hold seats in parliament. This body of ministers of the Crown is the Cabinet.</p>
